Great work on the assignment. Its pretty close to the original, and I only have a couple of notes. 

First, where's the image? I noticed you have a path to the location for an image, but its nowhere in your folders and so appears broken when the index file open.

Second, excellent job on naming your classes and IDs, and applying css to them! Everything is clear, organized, and there's very little code repetition (with the exception of font-weight and font-family: normal...find a way to reuse this).

Keep up the good work!
